            <h4>Step One</h4>
            <h4>Discover</h4>
            <p>Once your project is booked, we schedule a 1:1 brand strategy call to take an in-depth look at your business goals, your audience, and what sets you apart.
                With a solid strategy in place, we outline your project goals, ways to connect with your audience, and put together visual inspiration to guide us through the design process.
                This will make sure we’re on the same page before we start creating your brand identity.</p>

                <h4>Step Two</h4>
                <h4>Create</h4>
                <p>During this stage, we dive deeper to explore color and type then present the strongest concepts for your brand identity. Each concept includes a brief explanation about the meaning behind the design.
                    The concept presentation allows you see how each design works in real life and in different environments like packaging and print.
                    You’ll be able to share constructive feedback and we’ll work on any refinements as needed.</p>

                <p>We will refine concepts based on your feedback. Once approved, we create any collateral pieces you have chosen for your project.
                    Lastly, we put everything together in a detailed brand style guide that explains how to use your new branding consistently—from layout, to size, to color.
                    Last but not least, we carefully organize all your files and send over a link to download your final brand assets before moving forward to your website.
