            <p> Grew up in Cannes, France and mooved around the globe since 2012.
                I studied Interior Design and  become a Barista while travelling. 
                </p>
                <p>Few years ago, I got into coding and loved it. 
                So I decided to mix it with my design background. 
                
                I use nature & interior design as inspiration to built
                minimaliste, modern website. 
                
                Today I am based in Denmark, but who knows where
                I‘ll be tomorrow….It's time to show the world (wide web) exactly who you are, one piece of code at a time. </p>
