            <p> Grew up in Cannes, France and left to Australia in 2012. After that I just mooved around the globe.
                Travel lover, I studied Interior Design to switch 
                and  become a Barista for years. 
                I know really well the industry of hospitality / hotels.</p>
                <p>Few years ago, I got into coding and loved it. 
                So I decided to mix it with my design background. 
                
                I use nature & interior design as inspiration to built
                minimaliste, modern website. 
                
                Today I am based in Denmark, but who knows where
                I ‘ll be tomorrow….</p>
